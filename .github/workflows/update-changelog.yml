          # Optional
          # If your project keeps separate branches for major releases, and you want to point the compare URL
          # in the "Unreleased"-heading to the corresponding major release branch (eg. `2.x`), then enable the option
          # below.
          # `compare-url-target-revision` will change how the compare URL is composed and will replace
          # `v2.0.1...HEAD` with `v2.0.1...2.x`.
          # WARNING: When you select `main` when creating a new release, the value `refs/heads/main`
          # is passed to the Action which will generate an invalid compare URL.
